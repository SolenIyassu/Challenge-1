The things that I for this assignment. 

I changed the title to Horiseon

Found out the reason that Search Engine Optimization was not able to link to the section below. Added the id "Search engine optimization" to the id and add it with quotations as well.


Moved the placement of <p> tags to the top

I consolidated h2 from the initial class css edits such as Social Media, Online Reputation Management and Search Engine Optimization. 

Moved all the <h> tags to the top as well. 

Removed the <h2> from the footer class due the the dupicates in the multiple tags. Left the Footer tag for items that could not be parsed out. 

I consolidated the h3 out of the original class of Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management
